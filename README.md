# Case Study #1: Danny's Dinerüçùüçú
Danny's Diner is a Japanese-based restaurant. The restaurant was founded in 2021 with the goal of providing 3 main dishes namely  Sushi, Curry, and Ramen.

After a couple of months, a dataset was built which showcased the restaurant's growth and customer habits. In an effort to increase the business's growth and understand customer purchasing habits, an analysis of the existing dataset was requested.

## Problem Statement
The founder had a couple of questions concerning the business. Their aim was to get a good idea of customers purchasing patterns, best-sold products, etc. in order to help build a deeper relationship with customers and deliver a more personalized experience.

## Role
Data Analyst (SQL Developer)

## Tools Used
PostgreSQL, Valentina Studio

## Process
The project's dataset was downloaded from this [site](https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/2rM8RAnq7h5LLDTzZiRWcd/138)

### Pain Points
---
Here's a list of the case study questions that needed to be answered:
1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?
6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
8. What are the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customers A and B have at the end of January?

### Walkthrough
---
A database was created in PostgreSQL (within Valentina Studio). Three tables were created within the database namely "members", "menu" and "sales". Each table contained a primary key/unique ID which allowed enabled us to build a STAR-SCHEMA model for the data analysis process.

### 1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?

```SQL
SELECT customer_id, SUM(price)
FROM sales as s
    INNER JOIN menu as m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id;
```

#### Result set:
| customer_id | total_sales |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 76          |

### 2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?

```SQL
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(DISTINCT order_date) AS "Number of Days with Purchase"

| customer_id | Number of Days with Purchase |
| ----------- | -----------------------------|
| A           | 4                            |

    FROM sales 
        INNER JOIN menu ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
    ORDER BY customer_id
)
SELECT *
